# rustdoc

- a rust utlity for structured text documentation

- I am using this project to learn rust - clone at your own risk!

# to do

- [x] add output variables from `open_file()` to switch working file

- [x] create left panel with explorer

- [ ] add dialog to choose folder and remember folder\

  - use the [directories crate](https://docs.rs/directories/5.0.1/directories/struct.BaseDirs.html) to access a platform-agnostic cache

- [ ] add match case for how to handle different files and folders in explorer

- [ ] add case for if the `add file` is in the working directory (if needed)

- [ ] make `add file` / `add folder` remember the path used last time
